# Snake Game

This is a simple Snake game built using the `turtle` graphics module in Python. The game features a snake that moves around the screen, eats food to grow longer, and avoids colliding with itself or the walls.

## Features
- **Snake Movement**: The snake moves in four directions (up, down, left, right).
- **Food Generation**: Food randomly appears on the screen, and when eaten, the snake grows.
- **Score Tracking**: The score increases as the snake eats food, and the high score is maintained.
- **Game Over**: The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or itself.
- **Speed Up**: As the snake grows, the game speed increases.

## Game Controls
- **W**: Move the snake up.
- **S**: Move the snake down.
- **A**: Move the snake left.
- **D**: Move the snake right.

## How to Play
1. Ensure you have Python and the `turtle` module installed on your system.
2. Copy the provided Python code into a file (e.g., `snake_game.py`).
3. Run the script in your terminal or IDE.
4. Use the W, A, S, D keys to control the snake and eat food.
5. The game ends when the snake hits a wall or its own body.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
